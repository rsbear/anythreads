# Anythreads Contributing Guide

Anythreads is a community project and we welcome contributions from the community. Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system. Please read the root `package.json` for a complete list of commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsbear/anythreads.git
cd anythreads
bun install:all
```

## Running the Tests
To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the tests and generate a coverage report in the `coverage` directory.
