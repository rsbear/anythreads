# Anythreads Roadmap

## Extend the React CSR package
With more components for:
- Creating threads
- Banning/Unbanning users
- Deleting threads, replies, votes, and accounts

## RSC (React Server Components)
A suite of RSC components to empower users who use frameworks like Next.js, Waku, etc..

## Server Sent Events API
The API for this has not been designed or even thought about yet. It will however need things like:
- `anythreads.threads.completeStream(threadId)`
- A set of drop in web request handlers similar to the ones in `web-APIs/webrequest.md`
- A strategy for handling it in the `@anythreads/react` package
