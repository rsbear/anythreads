## Example Usage

<br />
**Server side**

Only one database is adapter is supported, if you try passing in more than one `createAnythreads` will throw
```ts
// server/index.ts
import { createAnythreads } from "@anythreads/api";
import { Database } from "bun-sqlite";

const db = new Database("file:test.db");

const at = createAnythreads({ bunSQLite: db })

const createThread = await at.threads.create({ ... })
if (createThread.isErr) return createThread.err

const thread = await at.threads.findOne(createThread.data.id)
if (thread.isErr) return createThread.err
```

<br />
<br />
**Client side**

Only `adapter.fetch` is supported in browser environments. 
```ts
// client/index.ts
import { createAnythreads } from "@anythreads/api";

const at = createAnythreads({ fetch: { url }})

const createThread = await at.threads.create({ ... })
if (createThread.isErr) return createThread.err

const thread = await at.threads.findOne(createThread.data.id)
if (thread.isErr) return createThread.err
```
